# Our mission

dumbfunded is dedicated to making fun of things that a lot of people spend a lot of their 
lives building, but maybe they shouldn't, you know? 

Like all of the best startups, no one knows it exists, no one knows how it will ever make 
money, and it really only exists to spend that sweet VC money.

# Our business fundamentals

dumbfunded will always be free of advertising, and is only supported by the kindness of 
companies that mysteriously like to do work for free (or nearly free).

dumbfunded's current burn rate is **$19.16** per month. At this rate, dumbfunded can remain in 
operation for **200 years**.

# Our generous sponsors

dumbfunded would be a huge pain in the ass to bring to you if not for the selfless 
efforts of a number of companies that have generously decided to turn their VC money into 
free (or nearly free) services.

### [GitHub](https://github.com/)
Hosts the [git repository](https://github.com/dumbfunded/dumb-site) the site lives in. While
the repo had to be public to keep the cost at $0, who cares.

### [NS1](https://ns1.com/)
Hosts authoritative DNS for `dumbfunded.io`. No charge.

### [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
Open source static site generator that builds this here website. Costs nothing, naturally.

### [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
dumbfunded stores its original images in S3.

Average monthly cost: **$0.08** *(the credit card processing fee is higher than this!)*

### [imgix](https://www.imgix.com/)
Prepares and delivers images from S3 to you.

Average monthly cost: a whopping **$3.08**!

### [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
Churns the site milk into site butter with Hugo and then delivers it to your doorstep.

Average monthly cost: an astonishing **$9.00**!

### [nic.io](https://nic.io/)
Domain registry for the [.io](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io) TLD and the 
place to go to buy domains with very similar names to `dumbfunded.io`.

Average monthly cost: **$7.00**! Yep, the domain itself accounts for half of dumbfunded's budget.

### [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)
Gracious host of the [dumbfunded](https://twitter.com/dumbfundedit) Twitter feed, helping 
to bring links to all the people of the world. Twitter, of course, is famous for having
no discernable business model and thus is free.

# Our esteemed sponsor alumni

dumbfunded misses our dear former sponsors, and looks forward to writing about the 
inevitable ends of their businesses.

### [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/)
Used to host the site before Hugo and GitHub and Netlify came along.
Everything is served from the US East Coast with no CDN, it doesn't support SSL on custom 
domains, and nobody cares about it's alleged social networking aspects.

Tumblr also has some exciting ideas about scraping referrer data from links and jamming a 
**ton** of crud into your pages. They also have no business model, and thus it is totally
free.

### [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/)
Formerly handled DNS for `dumbfunded.io`, and was the CDN for image content. Mysteriously
this was free.
