# Our mission

dumbfunded is dedicated to making fun of things that a lot of people spend a lot of their 
lives building, but maybe they shouldn't, you know? 

Like all of the best startups, no one knows it exists, no one knows how it will ever make 
money, and it really only exists to spend that sweet VC money.

# Our business fundamentals

dumbfunded will always be free of advertising, and is only supported by the kindness of 
companies that mysteriously like to do work for free (or nearly free).

dumbfunded's current burn rate is **$19.16** per month. At this rate, dumbfunded can remain in 
operation for **200 years**.

# Our generous sponsors

dumbfunded would be a huge pain in the ass to bring to you if not for the selfless 
efforts of a number of companies that have generously decided to turn their VC money into 
free (or nearly free) services.
